# plot_clustering_comparison

In this file we plot a comparison of the clustering using a set of data between the algorithms of : 
    - MeanShift
    - Birch
    - DBSCAN
    - K-means
    

This example aims at showing characteristics of different clustering 
algorithms on datasets and also compare the final running time of each.
We used for this a random dataset and a dataset generated by making blobs.
